            Tetris, created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, is a classic puzzle video game featuring falling geometric
            shapes called Tetriminos. Players manipulate and arrange these pieces to complete horizontal lines,
            earning points and preventing the screen from filling up.
            Its simple controls and strategic depth make it accessible to a wide audience.
            Tetris has become a timeless favorite across various platforms, from its original release on the Electronika
            60
            to global success on the Nintendo Game Boy.
            Its iconic music and addictive gameplay, coupled with its impact on cognitive research, have solidified
            Tetris
            as a cultural phenomenon in the world of video games.
